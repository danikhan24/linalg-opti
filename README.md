## Setup for running the program
Create and activate a virtual environment:
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install the required python packages from the .txt file:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run the main program, which runs all exercises at once:
```
python3 main.py
```


## Assignment
The aim is to implement a dense feedforward neural network from scratch to perform classification whether, based on the 13 features, a patient has a heart disease.

The figures generated by the main program are found in the `figures/` folder. 

The implementation of exercise 1 can be found in `preprocessing/dim_red.py`.

The implementation of exercises 2 and 3 can be found in `neural_nets/neural_net.py`.

The implementation of exercise 4 can be found in `preprocessing/stratify.py`.

The values $K_i \in \{ 2,5,10\}$ and $N \in \{ 2,5,10\}$ are specified by adjusting the values of parameters `depth` and `width` at line 39 in `main.py`. The resulting accuracy score is shown in the terminal.
